# 2024 Presidential Elections in Venezuela

## Primaries

### Context

Venezuela's opposition primaries were organized by civil society and with no official government support. This vote arrives just days after Washington's decision to lift sanctions on Caracas in exchange for a commitment to hold free and fair elections in 2024. In a ceremony held in Barbados earlier in October 2023, the Biden administration agreed to ease sanctions on Venezuela's oil, gas, and gold sectors. This is the most extensive rollback since January 2019, when the Trump administration imposed extensive sanctions on Venezuela's ability to export oil, the country's primary revenue source, in response to a widely criticized presidential election.

Despite the agreement, the voting process faced several incidents in Venezuela. Journalists on the ground reported that tear gas was deployed at two voting centers, while the head of the organizing National Primary Commission revealed disruptions in their server, responsible for transmitting results, shortly after the closure of the voting centers. In San José de Tarbes, the nuns operating the voting center were threatened and forced to relocate the center.

In Venezuela, the opposition is deeply divided and the popularity of opposition leaders can be short-lived. Today's primary elections hold significant historical value, as they mark the first of their kind since 2012, in Hugo Chavez’ last presidential race a few months before his death. At the time, political parties joined forces, like today, to chose a candidate that would face-off the running President.

Maria Corina Machado, nicknamed the “iron lady” by the opposition, has maintained her position as a leading voice against the regime over the years — notably her rivalry against Hugo Chavez. Despite securing a victory in the primaries, it's important to note that Machado was excluded from the 2024 presidential race by Maduro's regime a few months ago, leaving some uncertainty regarding whether the expected opposition front-runner will be able to contest the presidential election next year. 

### Venezuela

More than two million people participated in the opposition primaries, which were held with no official government support in people's homes, schools and independently-owned locations across the country.

### New York City

Over 1,700 Venezuelans in New York City took part in Venezuela's primaries on Sunday Oct 22nd, 2023. This was a crucial step in selecting the candidate who will challenge Nicolas Maduro in the upcoming year, with more than 97% casting their votes in favor of Maria Corina Machado. The candidate was equally strong in across the diaspora, with unofficial results giving her 95% of the votes according to Caracas Chronicles.
